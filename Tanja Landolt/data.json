      "Description": "The experimental, minimalist, and paradoxical magazine tan&tum was developed as an interdisciplinary design project for the vocational baccalaureate. It was a collaborative effort involving three colleagues, with each member contributing their expertise to various aspects of the project. The magazine comprised 88 pages, meticulously crafted to reflect our deep exploration of minimalism. Central to our project was an investigation into consumer behavior and its implications. We delved into questions such as \"What defines minimalism?\" and \"Is our current level of consumerism sustainable or even desirable?\" Through thoughtful exploration, we challenged assumptions about the relationship between possessions and happiness. This critical examination of minimalism and consumerism was not only reflected in the content but also intricately woven into the design of the magazine itself. The layout, typography, and overall aesthetic were all carefully considered to convey our thematic message."
